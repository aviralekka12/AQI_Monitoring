# AQI Monitoring System - Field Calibration Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS
- **CO2 Sensor (MQ-135):** NEVER use "Zero Calibration". CO2 is never 0 ppm (outdoor average is ~420 ppm). Zeroing it will cause dangerously low readings indoors.
- **Warm-up:** Sensors must run for **30+ minutes** before ANY calibration.

## Which Mode Should You Use? (The Strategy)

Since you do not have a lab, rely primarily on **Mode 3 (R0)** and **Mode 2 (Span)**.

### 1. For First Setup: "Fresh Air" Calibration
**Use Mode:** Option 3 (R0 / Baseline)
**Why:** This recalibrates the sensor's physical reference point ($R_0$) to align with known clean air levels. It is far more accurate than simple offsets for non-linear MQ sensors.
**Procedure:**
1. Take the device **outside** in clean air (30+ mins warm-up).
2. Select **R0 / Baseline** for each sensor.
3. Enter the **Target Values** listed below.
4. Save. This "teaches" the sensor what clean air looks like.

### 2. For Fine-Tuning: Matching a Government Station
**Use Mode:** Option 2 (Span Cal)
**Why:** If a nearby official station says PM2.5 is "45" but yours says "38", use this to scale your reading up without altering the physics curve.
**Procedure:**
1. Stand near the Reference Station.
2. Select **Span Cal**.
3. Dial in the Target to match the station's reading.
4. Save. This applies a linear multiplier (Gain).

### 3. When to use Option 1 (Zero Cal)?
**Use Mode:** Option 1 (Zero Cal)
**Why:** Only for sensors that truly read 0 in clean air but have drifted to show a false positive.
**Example:** If Carbon Monoxide (CO) reads 5ppm in fresh air, use Zero Cal to force it to 0.

## Recommended Target Values for "Field Calibration"
Use these values when you are **outside in fresh air** and selecting **Mode 3 (R0 / Baseline)**.

| Sensor | Target Value to Input | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MQ-135 (CO2)** | **415 - 420 ppm** | Critical. Outdoor air is the global baseline. |
| **MQ-7 (CO)** | **0.0 - 0.1 ppm** | Clean air has virtually no CO. |
| **MQ-131 (O3)** | **10 - 20 ppb** | Ozone is rarely 0 outdoors (sunlight creates it). |
| **NO2 (MEMS)** | **5 - 10 ppb** | Trace amounts exist even in "clean" cities. |
| **VOC (MEMS)** | **50 - 100 ppb** | Plants emit natural VOCs; 0 is unrealistic. |
| **MQ-2 (SO2)** | **0 ppb** | Combustible gases should be 0. |
| **MQ-137 (NH3)** | **0 ppm** | Ammonia should be 0. |
| **PM 2.5 / 10** | **Check Weather App** | Look up local AQI. If app says 15 µg/m³, enter 15. |
